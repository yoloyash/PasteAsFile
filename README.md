# PasteAsFile

This project is a Python-based Windows utility that runs in the system tray. Its core function is to convert text from the clipboard into a temporary file. Triggered by a Ctrl+Alt+V hotkey, it performs the conversion and copies the new file to the clipboard, ready for pasting, confirmed by a brief visual spinner.
